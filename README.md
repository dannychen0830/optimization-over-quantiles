## Quantum Optimization

This project is a joint work with Zain Saleem, James Stokes, and Brajesh Gupt.

The environment that were used can be created by running

> conda env create -f ./vmc_rusty.yml

or loading packages individually. Also, install [this MIS solver](https://karlsruhemis.github.io/). It's quite good and is used as a benchmark.
